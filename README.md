# ErrorHandlings

This contract demonstrates error handling mechanisms in Solidity.

## Requirements

- Solidity version: ^0.8.0

## Description

The `ErrorHandlings` contract provides functions for manipulating a `value` variable while enforcing specific conditions using error handling techniques.

## Error Handling Mechanisms

Solidity provides three error handling mechanisms: `revert`, `require`, and `assert`. Let's understand each of them:

### `revert`

The `revert` statement is used to revert the current transaction and discard any changes made so far. It is typically used when a condition is not met or to provide an error message. In this contract, the `decrementValue` function uses `revert` to revert the transaction if the value of `value` is less than the amount to decrement.

### `require`

The `require` statement checks a certain condition and throws an exception if the condition evaluates to false. It is commonly used to validate inputs or enforce preconditions. In this contract, the `setValue` function uses `require` to ensure that the provided `newValue` is not zero before assigning it to `value`.

### `assert`

The `assert` statement checks a certain condition and throws an exception if the condition evaluates to false. It is used to check for conditions that should never occur, indicating a bug in the code. In this contract, the `incrementValue` function uses `assert` to ensure that the sum of `value` and `amount` does not overflow.

## Functions

### `setValue(uint newValue)`

This function sets the value of `value` to the provided `newValue` parameter.

- Parameters:
  - `newValue` (uint): The new value to be assigned to `value`.

### `incrementValue(uint amount)`

This function increments the value of `value` by the provided `amount` parameter.

- Parameters:
  - `amount` (uint): The amount to be added to the current value of `value`.

### `decrementValue(uint amount)`

This function decrements the value of `value` by the provided `amount` parameter.

- Parameters:
  - `amount` (uint): The amount to be subtracted from the current value of `value`.
